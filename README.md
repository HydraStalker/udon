# udon
`udon` is an audio playback library designed with game engines in mind. It's built for optimal real-time performance while having a simple user interface.  It exists simply because there are no usable alternatives in the entire Rust ecosystem at time of writing, so we had to make our own.

Project began on 2021-03-14 and is mainly a backend for OpenGMK, but PRs are welcome.


I modified this version of Udon to accept newer versions of CMake for a project, no other changes have been made.
